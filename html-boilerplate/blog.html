        <h1>Measures to deal with stress when learning something new</h1>
            <p>It has been said in learning something new to <em>trust the process</em>.
                In learning both new spoken and programming languages this saying is applicable
                to me personally. At times, it can get stressful learning something new, 
                and so I have created this document to provide some solutions to this problem.

                <p>
                    I have found in my past that I would rely on intellisense or other code completion
                    editing features to write code when first learning. While this is practical from a 
                    time management standpoint, if one is first learning how to code, it is useful to
                    completely understand the structure/syntax of the language and the underlying <em>why</em>
                    or reason for something. For instance, in Python, if one were to just type "def init" and
                    tab, the function would be auto completed to def __init__(self):, but it leaves out the self, 
                    underscores, parentheses and semicolon. This leaves out the understanding of syntax and semantics
                    of the language. Once one understands what is actually going on, then autocomplete is awesome.
                    If there's one takeaway from this paragraph: manually type code to start off to understand the
                    underlying meaning and build memory.

                    Here's a funny example for this one: the word <strong>problem</strong> in
                    Japanese Romanji is "mondai". This word is so similar to "Monday" and usually
                    Mondays aren't the most fun day of the week, so this is one fun way to recall
                    and memorize information.
